Teaching studnet organic chemistry principles, including the study of carbon-based compounds, their structures, functional groups, and systematic naming conventions. Experienced with the fundamentals of hydrocarbons, particularly alkanes, and the differentiation between organic and inorganic carbon compounds.

Introduction to Organic Chemistry
======
Introduction to the chemistry of carbon-containing compounds emphasizing covalent bonding and molecular structure.

IUPAC nomenclature
======
Teach student how to identify and name functional groups following IUPAC nomenclature rules.

Sterochemistry
======
Help student to develop a deep understanding of stereochemistry, including isomerism, chirality, and spatial arrangement of atoms in molecules.

Electronic effetcs
======
Work on the electronic effects such as inductive, resonance, and hyperconjugation influences on molecular reactivity and stability.
