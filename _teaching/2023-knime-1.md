I delivered a talk introducing KNIME as a powerful tool for data analysis, explained molecular fingerprints and descriptors along with their associated file formats, and demonstrated fundamental machine learning concepts. Additionally, I guided participants through the process of building machine learning models and creating automated pipelines using KNIME.
