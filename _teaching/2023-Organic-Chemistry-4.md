I delivered a course on organic chemistry principles to students of Biology, Chemistry, and Geology (Spring Semester), covering the study of carbon-based compounds, their structures, functional groups, and systematic naming conventions. The course included fundamentals of hydrocarbons, particularly alkanes, and the distinction between organic and inorganic carbon compounds.

Introduction to Organic Chemistry
======
Introduction to the chemistry of carbon-containing compounds emphasizing covalent bonding and molecular structure.

IUPAC nomenclature
======
Teach student how to identify and name functional groups following IUPAC nomenclature rules.

Sterochemistry
======
Help student to develop a deep understanding of stereochemistry, including isomerism, chirality, and spatial arrangement of atoms in molecules.

Electronic effetcs
======
Work on the electronic effects such as inductive, resonance, and hyperconjugation influences on molecular reactivity and stability.
